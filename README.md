# hello-world

I said I was going to clean the living room today, but I'm building a new site and teaching myself from the bottom how to build and maintain a web site. I'm nearly 37 years old and I feel like I'm decades behind most 14 year-olds when it comes to tech and site building know-how. Good. I'll learn. If I could learn to how to make espresso drinks for assholes at Tartine and do phone sex with articulate, animate hard-ons, I'm _positive_ I can master web dev.

**I will make it through this year if it kills me.**
